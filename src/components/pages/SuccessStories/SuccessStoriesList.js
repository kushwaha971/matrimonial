      It was a casual Saturday afternoon where I had come across her profile and 8.5 months later here we are getting married.
      The site UX flow is neat and has all the relevant filters that you want to exercise on the first look to qualify a partner.`,

    story: `I am grateful to VTUShaadi.com for helping me to find the love of my life. Her profile on VTUShaadi.com was so impressive, I couldn't resist myself to send her request. She accepted it and we developed our bond slowly. In a month, me & my family went to see her at her place. I literally fell in love with her, when I saw her in yellow saree and in a week, I proposed her as I didn't want to lose such a pretty girl :).`,

    story: `Thanks a lot for your wishes. Yes as a matter of fact, we found a match for her through litlim website only :) Its just that we wish not to publicize it on the website. Our experience with you guys has been awesome. Unlike other matrimonial websites, we were not over burdened by hundreds of profiles and hence it made our search very convenient after putting up the filters. Kudos to you and your team for the great work...!!!`,

  Last but not the least the idea of starting a matrimonial service in a niche sector has done wonders in the lives of many and I would like to see the platform flourish to greater heights with better network effects.`,
